            “If it were possible for any nation to fathom another people's
            bitter experience through a book, how much easier its future fate
            would become and how many calamities and mistakes it could avoid.
            But it is very difficult. There always is this fallacious belief:
            'It would not be the same here; here such things are impossible.'
            <br> Alas, all the evil of the twentieth century is possible everywhere
            on earth.”
